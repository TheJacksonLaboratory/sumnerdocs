Set channel priority \u00b6 Important Prefer installing compilers only from a single channel and avoid mix-and-match install. Read more at conda-forge page on channel_priority: strict which is enabled at default for conda v4.6 or higher. Add Bioconda and conda-forge channels to get updated and compbio related packages. Avoid changing order of following commands unless you prefer to keep a different priority for these channels. 1 2 3 conda config --add channels defaults conda config --add channels bioconda conda config --add channels conda-forge Above command will generate ~/.condarc file and set priority for channels, i.e., when same package is available from more than one channels, we prioritize installation per ordered channel list in ~/.condarc file as shown below. This file should be present after above commands and no need to edit unless changing priority of channels. This is in yaml format file. Please take care of preceding spaces (and not tabs) before and after - while editing this file. 1 2 3 4 channels: - conda-forge - bioconda - defaults Install R 3.6.1 \u00b6 For compatibility with conda env, prefer installing R 3.6 via conda. Prefer installing R env from conda-forge channel which is already a priority channel in our ~/.condarc . We also specify R version, just to make sure that we install R v3.6.1. Beware of non-standard conda packages Note that most up-to-date R version may be available in the same or other conda channels, like r or bioconda but it is preferable to install R from the first priority channel, i.e., conda-forge in our case, and where package does not show non-standard labels at anaconda website, e.g., As of writing this section, R 3.6.2 on anaconda website shows use of non-standard labels, most likely because it was updated a few days before and so, may not comply with all of conda dependency. 1 2 3 4 ## look for a line r-base and check source channel. ## If it is other than conda-forge, try to downgrade R package where ## r-base is available under conda-forge channel. conda install -c conda-forge r-base = 3 .6.1 Above command will take 15-30 min to resolve dependencies. It will do major overhaul of default conda environment by... upgrading conda to latest version, 4.8.2 or higher. installing conda and r-base from conda-forge source. and much more... Pin R and conda auto-updates \u00b6 Before moving further, let's pin R version to 3.6.1 and also disallow conda auto-updates. That way, we have lesser chances of breaking conda env when we do conda install <pkg> in future, and carefully install/update packages without breaking existing setup. Compile over conda install Rpkg Typically, I avoid installing or updating package if conda install throws a message or warning about removing or downgrading existing packages. In such cases, I fall back to compiling package using available devtools in conda and sumner. Also, I load compiled package using Modulefile when needed, and not integrate it in my default bash environment as this may give errors while running some random program due to conflicts in shared library versions. 1 2 3 4 conda config --set auto_update_conda False ## add following to pinned file nano ~/anaconda3/conda-meta/pinned r-base ==3.6.1 Setup Rprofile and Renviron \u00b6 Setup R package directory path for R 3.6 1 mkdir -p ~/R/pkgs/v3.6 Create these two files to setup startup env for R Renviron 1 nano ~/.Renviron Where should R save new packages? Over time, this directory may grow in size, so better to keep under tier1 storage. 1 R_LIBS = \"/projects/verhaak-lab/yoda/sumnerenv_os7/R/pkgs/v3.6:/home/yoda/R/pkgs/v3.6:/home/yoda/anaconda3/lib/R/library\" You can confirm precedence of R library paths in R using .libPaths() command. Note that /home/yoda/anaconda3/lib/R/library is a required path set while installing R using conda.

Then, login back to sumner and start interactive queue again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 exit # from interactive session exit # from sumner ssh sumner ## start interactive session srun -p compute -q batch -N 1 -n 3 --mem 10G -t 08 :00:00 --pty bash Confirm that login env is similar to earlier env (just after anaconda3 setup) by running env command. PATH should now have paths related to conda env prefixed but nothing else related to modules, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. Also, make sure that module: gcc is unloaded. We do not want system gcc (or any other devtools), and instead rely on conda-installed devtools. 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## unload gcc if loaded module unload gcc ## example PATH variable /home/yoda/anaconda3/bin:/home/yoda/anaconda3/condabin:/cm/shared/apps/slurm/18.08.8/sbin:/cm/shared/apps/slurm/18.08.8/bin :/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/yoda/.local/bin:/home/yoda/bin Avoid Rpkgs using conda install Install essential R packages and jupyter kernel for R only if they are available for R 3.6.x (preferably v3.6.1) from conda-forge channel. This may not be a case for most times, e.g., for R v3.5.1, I can find compatible packages but not for R 3.6. I avoid downloading r-essentials from other channels, including r as some packages have dependencies on shared library which are different between r and conda-forge channel. I prefer installing R packages using install.packages , devtools::install_github() or BiocManager command in R. 1 2 ## This did not work for R 3.6.1 # conda install -c conda-forge r-essentials Installing R and linux packages \u00b6 Here, I alternate between R and bash to install packages I use on regular basis. It is going to take a while to install these packages. You may not need to install all packages but if you are skipping ahead and get into error because of missing library, package, etc., you probably need to revisit this code block and confirm that you have all of dependencies in your environment for successful installation. 1 install.packages ( \"devtools\" ) When you start installing R packages, notice x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-cc or other compilers that R is using instead of /usr/bin/gcc or sumner-defaults. Similarly, during loading R packages which requires shared libraries, we link shared libs from conda and not from system-defaults (gcc and others). That's one of reasons I did module unload gcc before installing R packages. Eventually, we will set ~/.profile.d environment such that it will always load conda environment and ignore gcc and other devtools from system paths.

This may not be a case for most times, e.g., for R v3.5.1, I can find compatible packages but not for R 3.6. I avoid downloading r-essentials from other channels, including r as some packages have dependencies on shared library which are different between r and conda-forge channel. I prefer installing R packages using install.packages , devtools::install_github() or BiocManager command in R. 1 2 ## This did not work for R 3.6.1 # conda install -c conda-forge r-essentials","title":"Setup Rprofile and Renviron"},{"location":"conda/S01_conda/#installing-r-and-linux-packages","text":"Here, I alternate between R and bash to install packages I use on regular basis. It is going to take a while to install these packages.

Similarly, during loading R packages which requires shared libraries, we link shared libs from conda and not from system-defaults (gcc and others). That's one of reasons I did module unload gcc before installing R packages. Eventually, we will set ~/.profile.d environment such that it will always load conda environment and ignore gcc and other devtools from system paths.
